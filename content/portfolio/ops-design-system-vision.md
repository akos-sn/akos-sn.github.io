Challenge

</bb-tags>

We were facing a plateau of adoption and encountered voices distrustful of the design system's value despite the clear benefits. We decided to go on a bit of a marketing campaign and amplifying the added value of a design system beyond a component kit.

Approach

</bb-tags>

Our approach was to point out how slowly we could implement a change in our design language with a monolithic legacy system, and how expensive it can get. If we have a widely adopted design system, we reclaim our agency over our product.

## Project plan

When we were picking up this task I already had a few sketches to go out from as a start, and proven my [project leadership track record](../portfolio/ops-design-system.html), I stepped into the leading role this time as well.

I was already familiar with the skillset of the designers I was working with, and due to our very short timeframe of one week (until a presentation to our CEO and the Product Leadership), I was confident we will make something valuable. 

The plan was to create new themes to the design system that would look less like a transition from the old UI from our old tech stack to something in-between, but something forward-thinking and actually new, still maintaining the friendly/business-casual design language of TOPdesk as a brand.

We picked three cornerstone pages that are different enough to showcase the system-centricism of the concepts.

## Implementation

## Learning

I have learned a lot about leadership that week, and how it is very much an art. High stress and time crunch made me overlook some fundamental leadership ideas. Namely, recognising that different people require different leadership styles. And I had a team of two with two vastly different requirements. This fact alone was very humbling and we addressed that in a post-mortem.

## Outcome

We ended up showing the presentation to the entire department that was really engaging based on the reactions. Following that we experienced percievably higher interest, higher traffic, more questions in our Q&A Teams channel, higher attendance in our sprint reviews.
