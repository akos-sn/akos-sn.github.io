CHALLENGE

</bb-tags>

We were taking on a legacy project update filled with technical limitations. With a mono-functional frontend engineering team and another designer we had no impact on the backend.

Our domain’s primary goal is to deflect calls that could be solved with information already existing in the client’s knowledge base.

APPROACH

</bb-tags>

We had the idea to have a design sprint and generate ideas for this project with hard technical limitations.

## Design Sprint

I took on the organisation and facilitation of the sessions. Our setup was a tad unusual in that we included our engineers in the whole process. 

They were really enthusiastic during the user journey mapping session and because of the feasibility concerns we had scheduled in time for the engineers to conduct feasibility spikes while I was ideating with my peer designer.

Around the end of day two, with our ideas presented, we dissected the proposals and picked one solution that is both high feasibility and high impact.

Our idea included an AI summarisation of available articles and we managed to help the users by extracting keywords from their search query.

### We decided to build it

Our unusual design sprint turned into a hackathon. We already had interviews scheduled for Thursday afternoon with internal consultants, and for Friday afternoon with clients we had contact with from the exploratory interviews.

The engineers started with a simple prototype, while us designers were working on the design handoff specs.

We had a coded prototype by the end of Thursday. 

### A sidebar about data

As designers we picked up the habit of reading REST API response JSONs to figure out if we have access to certain information at any given time.

This constraint remained with us even after the design sprint into a beta period.
