Context

</bb-tags>

We have gotten to the point of our UX Maturity journey to measure our efforts. We had *some* prior practices, but disconnected, sporadic, and inconsistent. 

I joined this project to promote the importance of UX outside of the boundaries of our immediate environment and showcase our efforts' measurable value. But that's a very difficult thing to do for a qualitative thing that is UX.

## Approach

As a group of 4 UX practitioners we did a number of things. I found a [course by Vitaly Friedman](https://measure-ux.com/) about this exact topic which became the spine of our research. 

Using this knowledge we went on to find industry best practices, create a shortlist of applicable, relevant and easiliy repeatable set of methodologies/metrics, and tested the recommended framework.

## Learnings

### Shared language

As with the [Design System case study](../portfolio/ops-design-system.html), I realised that a common pitfall for selling the value of UX is a misalignment of language. As UX practitioners we are required to translate our views to different contexts and that requires a solid communication component to our already demanding skillset. 

### Where research efforts fail

At least in our context. We have measured the performance of our designs and these measurements were happening in a vacuum most often. Which meant we lacked a baseline for a comparative sample, we not only moved the goal posts but played different games during the research journey. 

That weight of this realisation might have been subdued by the hindsight bias because this is such an obvious takeaway, but one of the most important ones in my opinion. Repeatability, and actually repeating the measurement is the key of a successful research effort.

## Outcome

We have made a list of suggestions for management to take with them based on our findings. I have brought the practice to my development team and we picked up the habit of thinking around the domain context, what is the purpose of our big picture goal, and how do we work towards this goal.

A result of this approach was an equation accurately measuring our effort to deflect call centre calls by providing better search results. That project is detailed in the [TOPdesk Self-Service Portal design sprint case study](../portfolio/ux-ssp.html).
