Challenge

</bb-tags>

When I started out at TOPdesk, I was an in-team designer at the design system. It was already a pretty expansive set of components and guidelines, but it wasn't consistent between the components implemented versus the Figma components.

A problem I wanted to solve is that designers and developers often don't speak the same language, and the component properties did reflect that.
