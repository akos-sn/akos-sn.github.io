Context

</bb-tags>

This project was a request from a handful of clients operating in different countries. The language recognition was driven by a Text Analysis API which was developed in-house to obviously analyse written text. 

This feature needed to be seamlessly integrated into the pre-existing Survey Builder, considering that this was a paid-for feature; the flow of information should be intact with or without this feature's availability.

Challenge

</bb-tags>

This feature needed to be accessible from an URL so that translators would get instant access to the translation workflow. The translation workflow needed to be understandable without clicking back-and-forth screens and display all the required information within a single screen.

This is the challenge
