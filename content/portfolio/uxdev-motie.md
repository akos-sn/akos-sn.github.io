Context

</bb-tags>

Motie is a practice micro-app project of mine.

The aim for this project is twofold. One is for me to have a project I can practice my ReactJS chops on, the other is to practice designing for a truly Human problem.

Challenge

</bb-tags>

The primary problem I try to face is the problem of overstimulation during planning. By creating restrictions, we're forced to make do with our toolkit. Without productivity features in every nook and cranny, we never waste time to select the proper tools. We only need a sticky note.
