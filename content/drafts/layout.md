Approaching this utterly broad topic was demanding and required a lot of reading. I have consulted our stakeholders for user pain-points, and have consulted this paper, to understand the industry's pain-points and underlying challenges, called [An optimization model for aircraft maintenance scheduling and re-assignment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965856402000046?via%3Dihub), which has been, to my understanding, a cornerstone study in maintenance scheduling.
