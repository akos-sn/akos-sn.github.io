## Dynamic layouts

</series-heading>

This article is an overview about what layout is with attention towards fluidity beyond pixels and screens. I will go into the history of layouts and how the concept has evolved with time.

## There is no pixel

The myth of the pixel-perfect design is long gone.

## Mobile first

To sufficiently understand mobile first design, one must first understand progressive enhancement.



### Progressive enhancement vs. Graceful degradation

Approaching this utterly broad topic was demanding and required a lot of reading. I have consulted our stakeholders for user pain-points, and have consulted this paper, to understand the industry's pain-points and underlying challenges, called [An optimization model for aircraft maintenance scheduling and re-assignment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965856402000046?via%3Dihub), which has been, to my understanding, a cornerstone study in maintenance scheduling.

> Quote by a person that can go on and on because I'm trying to get a pretty long quote so I'll just talk about the time when Ford probably said that he would have made a horse if he asked people, but that quote seems rather apocryphal. I should get a spell-checker plugin.
