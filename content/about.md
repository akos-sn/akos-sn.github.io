## About the website

I was always envious of the utilitarian minimalism of front-end engineers’ websites. The perceivably lightweight performance was something I wanted to achieve. So I wanted to build something really low-tech using markdown files for writing articles — I’ve been taking notes in markdown for years and I love how readable it is. It only made sense.
